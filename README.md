Our clients, the School of Code, gave us the brief:

>'Improve remote team building at the School of Code'

We solved this problem by creating a *gaming platform* and bespoke *'Facts!'* game to ultimately break down communication barriers and build rapport. This file contains the back-end section of the project.

The back-end was built using a websocket server, using the ws node package for the bi-directional communication between client and server. In terms of persisting the data we using AWS Dynamo DB and for Authorisation and Authentication we used AWS Cognito.

Both services were deployed using netlify. You can view them by following the links and signing up below:
